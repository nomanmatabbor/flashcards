Electrogravimetry Discrussion		Constant current electrolysis, separation with controlled electrode potentials. Physical characteristics of metal deposits.
Electrogravimetry	is a method to separate and quantify ions of a substance by depositing them upon a suitable electrode
Principal	deposition on an electrode(by Ohm's law and Faraday's law)
Faraday's law	the amount of deposition of substances is directly proportional to the quantity of passed electricity through the solution. Equaiton -> W propotional to Q, where, Q=It. That dissolved mass is proportional to the atomic mass divided by the number of electrons involved in the process. Eq-> W prop to Z, where Z = m(mass)/n(no. of e transfer)
What is the Z for Cu and Ag	  63.5/2 and 107.87
To take place Electrolysis	applied potential must overcome the decomposition potential(ED) of the electrolyte
Eapp > or equal to	ED + IR

Over potential	experimentally the extra potential needed for decomposition of electrolyte than calculated reversible back emf.
Overpotential occurs	 at the anode and the cathode
Decomposition voltage, ED =	Ecathode + Eoc - (Eanode + Eoa); Eoc and Eoa means overpotential of cathode and anode.
Another name or term for Electrolysis is	 the chemical decomposition
Types of over potential	1. conc op, 2. complexation op, 3. gas op, 4. activation op
Concentration Overpotential	the potential difference caused by variations of conc of reactants or products near the electrode surface compared to their bulk conc in the electrolyte.
Cathode	negative charged as reduction occurs here and electrons are getting accumulated.
Potential buffer	maintains the potential by oxidation and reduction reaction.
Example of a potential buffer	Urenium acts as a potential buffer: img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiH5AuypWsr_OadFDYEtNzgJLZAbiVGHT7W1W_yYSlVUDU81Sf_keNOb-7A1XTctiCMABcNhw8X74c0NuHzZvAFZb_83u7iVv3qoaA8wOVh4tAEHg4uU1g6wjuQ8zla4praysjpMsMx9k0fH6dysBS20Z2wDv9aa70kF49a-L6Z4E_xNVmIW64WHci1ou-F)
