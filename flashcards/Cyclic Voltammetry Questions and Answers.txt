peak potential separation for a reaction	The separation of the peak potentials, Epa - Epc, is an important parameter in cyclic voltammetry which can be used to calculate the reversibility of the reaction. The peak potential separation for a reaction with reversible electron transfer is given by: Epa-Epc = {~59/n} mV
ratio of the peak currents for reversible systems is 	A ratio of the peak currents, ipa/ipc which is one for reversible systems, is another important parameter in these systems. It is independent of the scan rate.

Factors affecting electrode reaction rate	(1) Mass transfer (e.g., from the bulk solution to the electrode surface). (2) Electron transfer at the electrode surface. (3) Chemical reactions preceding or following the electron transfer. (4) Other surface reactions.
The magnitude of this current is often	 limited by the inherent sluggishness of one or more reactions called rate-determining steps.

Quasi-reversible Systems	- In between reversible and irreversible systems, - Current is controlled by both charge transfer and mass transport, - Voltammograms are more drawn out or big, - Exhibit larger separation in peak potentials compared to reversible systems, - Shape depends on heterogeneous rate constant and scan rate, - Exhibits irreversible behaviour at very fast scan rates
microelectrodes having possibility 	in vivo electrochemistry.
The advantages of micro electrodes	small ir drops, require low dielectric constants, the capacitive charging current is reduced, the rate of mass transport increases, and steady state current is established within a micro secode.
Mass transport in microelectrode	at short time microelectrode behaves as microelectrode (planar diffusion), at longer times, it shows its behaviour (spherical diffusion.). so current at microelectrode is a sum of both planar and spherical diffusion
electrochemical reaction at electrode interface	For a cell to do any useful work or for electrolysis to occur, a significant current must need to flow. th output voltage depend on ✓ ohmic potential, ✓ concentration polarization (overpotential), and ✓ Kinetic polarization (overpotential)
How much voltage should be applied? to make a reaction occur?	img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhMp2qUp8RfzoYMqVWIgf104mcGH5DWREO4YWC3A0KNc2hW0jLCImtrqVUgMuT5NdKgLNh4S3EkFxUJKezHJAqtRh64c6oxOPHcKJgaWN22_T59-1yNCzYQTOYZIhai77dZ1i2tPWHUngzP88f6iiClSAB3xr98YP8SY9AAZeO6c43ZWx3N2D78HFfc6nSw)
Overvoltage	 it is the extra potential that must be applied beyond what we predict from the Nernst equation
Ohmic Potential 	• The voltage needed to force current (ions) to flow through the cell is called the ohmic potential and is given by Ohm's law: Eohmic = IR; where I is the current and R is the resistance of the cell.
Concentration polarization 	(overpotential ) • This takes place when the concentration at the electrode surface is different than that in the bulk solution.
Factors that affect concentration polarization 	Among the factors causing ions to move toward or away from the electrode are ✓ diffusion, ✓ convection, ✓ electrostatic attraction or repulsion. Also, the greater the electrode surface area, the more current can be passed without polarization.
How can we reduce the concentration polarization?
how can we reduce the concentration polarization?	✓ Increase temperature thereby increasing the rate of diffusion of the species ✓ Increase stirring ✓ Increase electrode surface area: more reaction takes place ✓ Change ionic strength to increase or decrease attraction between electrode and reactive ion.
Suppose that a solution containing 0.20 M Cu2+ and 1.0 M H+ is electrolyzed to deposit Cu(s) on a Pt cathode and to liberate O2 at a Pt anode. Calculate the voltage needed for electrolysis. If the resistance of this cell is 0.44 ohm. Estimate the voltage needed to maintain a current of 2.0 A. Assume that the anode overpotential is 1.28 V and there is no concentration polarization.	img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhyruehEuxi7uCtA-wQHKtZnCUQc1ufO-9oIy78yQ9XuVFdVlxqWhnkF0bg7zTVSLWNqxJurNbykZuXDW4KcJHJxrlKMphJ4_WMNAsNOEpZ9bU76ir-BUdAxYJ56QARe_ZSQMDWpp2481lB9m6SO-R7a2uMCAYpuj577ooXgz5xn9OOrtLiRpko0D6IB60W) img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjgYD0AHItkr-eXBamiJA6JchESOk8K40fOIDBUE1vNWF71gRbvNSJoentqMsNbq7tVq3k231l3DQ9HNoJpeq_-Z2A4aGaFRDWGo7M_lEzkYj-NQ2TnIOCDgM48ejbWIzz-6qXydLMDZXLJ3rmdeEmSWjSWyaG03v7Jrxm1Xf2lpEQXTf9CyUIKeY3jcjrZ)
