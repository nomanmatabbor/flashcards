X-ray Diffraction	X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a technique that uses the diffraction of X-rays by a crystal to determine its atomic structure. <br>By analyzing the resulting diffraction pattern, scientists can understand the arrangement of atoms in a material, providing valuable insights into its properties.
Diffraction of X-rays is caused by	interaction with electrons in atoms in crystals
The key features of X-ray diffraction include	Bragg‚Äôs law, Diffraction pattern, Crystal structure determination, powder X-ray diffraction
Bragg‚Äôs law	This law, formulated by Sir William Bragg and his son William Lawrence Bragg, describes <b><i>the relationship between the angle of incidence of X-rays on a crystal and the angles at which the X-rays are diffracted</i></b>. The equation is given by: 2dsin(Œ∏)=nŒª<br>where: d is the interplanar spacing between crystal lattice planes, Œ∏ is the angle of incidence (or diffraction), n is an integer (the order of the diffraction), and Œª is the wavelength of the X-rays.
We can find out by calculating d	unit cell's size and shape, orientation of the crystallographic planes 
How to find out unit cell's size and shape, orientation of the crystallographic planes	By the following interplanar spacing and lattice parameter (unit cell size) relationship<br>img(https://cdn.britannica.com/28/6828-050-211C30F8/Bragg-diffraction.jpg)<br><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mi>a</mi><msqrt><mrow><msup><mi>h</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>k</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>l</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mfrac></mrow></math><br>where, d is the interplanar spacing, a is the lattice parameter (unit cell size), h, k, and l are the Miller indices that represent the orientation of the crystallographic plane.
Diffraction Pattern	The X-rays are diffracted by the crystal lattice planes, leading to a distinctive diffraction pattern. This pattern is recorded on a detector and provides information about the crystal structure, including the spacing between lattice planes.
Crystal Structure Determination	By analyzing the diffraction pattern, researchers can determine the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a crystal. This information is crucial for understanding the properties and behavior of materials.
Applications of X-ray diffraction	X-ray diffraction is widely used in various scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, material science, and biology. It is commonly employed to study crystalline materials such as minerals, metals, ceramics, and biological macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids.
Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)	In addition to single crystal XRD, there is also powder X-ray diffraction, which is used when a single crystal is not available. Powder diffraction involves analyzing a powdered sample, and the diffraction pattern is a superposition of the patterns from all the crystallites in the sample.

Debye-Scherrer Equation is derived from 	Bragg‚Äôs Law
Diffraction grating	A diffraction grating is a device with a surface containing closely spaced, parallel lines or rulings. When light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as X-rays, pass through the grating, they undergo diffraction, producing a pattern of bright and dark regions. Diffraction gratings are used to disperse light or analyze its spectrum, and in the context of X-rays, they are employed to study crystal structures through X-ray diffraction patterns. img(https://wasatchphotonics.com/wp-content/uploads/WP-grating-schematic2.png)
Nature and production of X-ray
X-ray generation	When high electron beam (1-1000eV) strike a metal target(Cu, Mo etc.)
What are the two prcesses occurred druing X-ray generation	When high-energy electrons hit a metal target in an X-ray tube, two things happen:<br>1. Continuous or Bremsstrahlung Radiation: <br>> High-energy electrons become slow down by collision with metal electrons emit X-rays. <br>> These X-rays form a continuous spectrum, meaning they cover a range of wavelengths.<br>2. Characteristic X-rays:<br>> Electrons knock out inner electrons in the metal.<br>> Other electrons then fill these gaps, emitting X-rays at specific, discrete energies.<br>> These specific X-ray energies appear as peaks on top of the continuous spectrum. img(https://i.imgur.com/t5b8KL7.png)
Electron beam generation in X-ray tube	The electron beam is accelerated towards an anode by a potential difference of about 30kV. The electrons strike the target and a spectrum of X-rays is emitted
X-ray tube components	Cathode: Tungsten filament, that work as an electron source, from where electron is emittied by thermionic emission method, when it is heated.<br>Anode: Copper, high energy electrons from the cathode strike the anode and X-rays are generated due to the intercations with tem metal atom or anode.<br>Anode may be made up of two metal such as cupper and tungsten (diagram using these anode is given as X-ray tube diagram).<br>Leaving Path of X-ray: Beryllium Window, this allows X-rays to pass through minimizing its absorption.<br>X-ray lines (k‚ç∫ and kùõΩ) filter: 1. Nickel (absorb Cu-kùõΩ) (Mnemonic: note(Ni) book(ùõΩ)); 2. Iron (absorb both) (Mnemonic: aso sobai); 3. Zinc (transmit both) (Mnemonic: zatha diye petabo sobaike)
X-ray tube diagram	Here the anode is made up of two metals. <br>img(https://radiologykey.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/C6-FF1.gif)
Operation of two metal (copper-tungsten) anode X-ray tube	1. The electrons generated at the cathode (typically tungsten filament) are accelerated towards this copper anode with a tungsten target.<br>2. When high-energy electrons strike the tungsten target, X-rays are produced as a result of interactions with the tungsten atoms.
Benefits of using two metal anode 	Copper Tungsten anode: 1. The copper component helps with efficient heat dissipation due to its good thermal conductivity. 2. The tungsten target is chosen for its high atomic number, which results in more efficient X-ray production and a higher-energy X-ray spectrum.
Variables that govern the X-ray diffraction techniques	1. Radiation: monochromatic or various wavelength <br>2. Sample: Single crystal, powder or a solid peice<br>3. Detector: Radiation counter or photographic film

Poweder Diffraction Method	Debye-Scherrer Method
Debye-Scherrer Method is used to analyse	Powder sample

Debye-Scherrer Method components	Photographic Film, powder sample (camera), two holes in the film: for incident and outgoing X ray
Powder are like 	polycrystalline sample
Which crystal plane contribute to a diffracted beam	those who satisfy Bragg‚Äôs condition 
What condition should be maintained by powder diffraction method?	Bragg‚Äôs condition of diffraction, diffract X-ray to detector
Debye-Scherrer Camera	This is a photographic film to detect x-ray.
Difference in diffracted pattern between powder and crystal sample	Polycrystalline or powder sample's diffracted beams are spread an out in a cone-like pattern. Where as for a single crystal, there is discrete diffraction spots.
Why cone shape is formed in powder diffraction method?	Because the crystals in the sample are randomly oriented with respect to the incident X-ray beam.
What is the angle of diffraction by a single crystal?	The angle 2Œ∏ is the angle of diffraction defined by Bragg's Law for a single crystal.
Why angle Angle 4Œ∏ in diffraction is considered in powder?	In the Debye-Scherrer method, due to the random orientation of crystals, the diffraction pattern is observed over a range of angles, and so the cone-shaped pattern is described by an angle of 4Œ∏. <br>Here, 4Œ∏ = 2*2Œ∏ (2 for incident + 2 for diffracted).
Each diffraction cone arises from	a set of Miller planes.
Equation of powder method	This also shows when the Œ∏ = S become, img(https://i.imgur.com/Mow7II2.png)
Limitation or powder method: 1. Long exposure time. 2. Weak intensity.
Reciprocal lattice	The reciprocal lattice is the diffraction pattern of real lattice
Systemtic Absences	In practice the intensity of the beams diffracted by certain sets of lattice planes may be zero. These are known as systematic absences.
Systematic Absences cause for 	variation of X-ray reflection intensities
Systematic Absences arises	either if the lattice type is non-primitive (I, F, etc) or if elements of space symmetry are present (glide plane, screw axis).
Primitive lattices are 	simpler, containing only one lattice point in their unit cell.
Primitive lattices example	simple cubic lattice, body-centered cubic (BCC), and face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice
Non-primitive lattices are	more complex, containing more than one lattice point in their unit cell.
Non-primitive lattice example	body-centered tetragonal (BCT), body-centered orthorhombic, and body-centered monoclinic lattices
How to calculate systemetic absences	For non-primitive lattice type, the formula for systematic absences in body center cube is (h+k+l)= Odd number, the set of planes is systematic absent. e.g. 100, 111,320 etc.

Origin of X-ray diffraction	In X-ray diffraction, destructive interference occurs when X-rays diffracted by one set of atoms exactly cancel out X-rays diffracted by a second set of atoms of the same type within a crystal lattice. This phenomenon results in reduced or eliminated intensity at certain angles in the diffraction pattern, providing crucial information about the crystal's atomic arrangement.
What is R-factor?	The R-factor, or reliability factor, is a metric to assess the goodness-of-fit between the observed and calculated X-ray diffraction data for a proposed crystal structure. <br>It is a measure of how well the theoretical model (calculated structure factors) matches the experimental data (observed structure factors).
Residual factor calculation	<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mo>&#x2211;</mo><mrow><mo>|</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>obs</mi></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>calc</mi></msub><mo>|</mo></mrow></mrow><mrow><mo>&#x2211;</mo><msub><mi>F</mi><mi>obs</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math><br>Here, F<sub>obs</sub> is the observed structure factor (experimental data).<br>F<sub>calc</sub> is the calculated structure factor (theoretical model).<br>The summation is done over all reflections(that means that the R-factor calculation involves summing the absolute differences between the observed structure factors and the corresponding calculated structure factors for all reflections in the X-ray diffraction data).
R-factor value analysis	The R-factor ranges from 0 to 1. A lower R-factor indicates a better agreement between the experimental and calculated data, suggesting a more accurate and reliable crystal structure determination. Conversely, a higher R-factor indicates a poorer fit.
Principle of Neutron diffraction	Neutrons interact primarily with atomic nuclei due to their neutral charge.
Applicaion of Neutron diffraction	Used for studying crystal structures, especially magnetic properties.
