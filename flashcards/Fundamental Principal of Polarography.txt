Polarography 	basic, applications, different factors, polarogram.
Polarography	Where current-voltage curves are studied. This is a voltammetric method of analysis.
Polarography procedure	Using of a cell consisting of working, reference and auxiliary electrodes. In detail: The procedure involves the use of a cell with an assembly of three electrodes: (1) a working electrode at which the electrolysis under investigation takes place; (2) a reference electrode which is used to measure the potential of the working electrode; and (3) an auxiliary electrode which, together with the working electrode, carries the electrolysis current.
Microelectrode in polarography	Dropping mercury electrode (DME) is used as a microelectrode.
Polarography is used 	for the analysis of electroreducible or oxidizable metals, ions or organic substances (electroactive species)
What electrodes are used in polarography generally?	One of the electrodes is a polarizable microelectrode (DME) while the other is a polarizable electrode.
Charge of DME is	 cathode (-ve) img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjLqTgS7aqhvMp9OZIRjdbXqCKc3tm-76zozESicpklLUV-en25oZnbT79zKG5ue-leuteJK1zSXYNZoZ-Gh6qB8zmT4FVF61vLQjTnglviQtw8ae8rNcJU4AJhKAWnwcmWKbrtLDI-MuveXl4DYmyFjsEnkPUc4FTANUPYciI2GPEq839w-NOdQZ6fWBk2)
How does the current flow in DME?	Upon applying the voltage, electroactive species will move towards DME, electron transfer occurs and a current flows.
The current produced in DME	 is proportional to the concentration of the electroactive species.
What are polarization and non-polarization in DME?	img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjn3iA0s8nloSsp9qOIDWHQcmvO93CBiyijEPtbtrJxWN_s6qQhFfDrhZfzuy_9V1ANWQr5Am0raWFEOXkARbdJWr-mEGYguNgCOVtqFLQGVPDHNFxYPDayKVFo8kmG1_SNW4GYnl6Y2-XkHfZ49wu0BhErUvgCg2S0LY4k_iSNEfOHC4yIqmas8KEYyent)
The polarizable electrode	potential of the electrode will change significantly from its equilibrium potential with the application of even a small current density.
The non-polarizable electrode	potential of the electrode will not change significantly from its equilibrium potential with the application of even a large current density.
Some basic terms on polarographic basic 	1. The potential is applied in the form of voltage. 2. The analyte present in the solution will be diffused under the application of voltage. 3. Ultimately current flow takes place due to the diffusion of analyte ions at the electrode surface and the current is diffusion current (Id). 4. Dropping mercury → Cathode (- ve charge; polarizable), Mercury pool → anode (+ charge; non-polarizable) img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjZohkj7LQ3qDOWmPNS6vVJ3p5xKNdX3WbHwcsMtlamMF16zMwY2bCfWsK6Hgp6szmLrKItMP67X-uMIPf0ahXZNQPJJKcIeXEWjgD_q-Eumq_GQOWHUaa2oUBgWUrQkTNFB7TQu9Y921n3JmuR5BvN0KcY_x0e9c3OgJkNjO7joNBjp4tFzHcdtcU-WtAx)
Residual current	(inhabitant) Combination of current produced by • Reduction of impurities • Current produced by Helmholtz double layer
Migration current 	(Migrate) is Produced by electrostatic attraction between positive species and the negative cathode and the species tend to migrate to the electrode. The migration current is negligible in polarography measurement.
Diffusion current 	(Diffuse) is Produced due to the diffusion of analyte species For example, Pb2+ +2e- → Pb0 • Depends on the analyte concentration
Limiting current 	(Reduced) When all the analyte species are reduced and current flows constantly.
Advantages of DME	reproducible potential, clean surface, wide negative potential range, reversible, H+ reduction does not interfere with others. In detail: • Hg yields reproducible current-potential data. • A new electrode surface forms every few seconds preventing the buildup of impurities or reaction products ↔ clean surface • Displays wide negative potential range • Many metal ions can be reversibly reduced into it • Expansion of drop area and decrease in diffusion-limited current counteract each other • The high overpotential for H+ reduction at the mercury surface. Therefore, H+ reduction does not interfere with many reductions.
Disadvantages of DME	• Hg is easily oxidized which prevents the use of more positive (oxidizing) potentials (above + 0.4 V) • At potential more negative than about -1.8 V Vs SCE, hydrogen evolution occurs in acid solution and the usual supporting electrolytes commence or start to discharge • DME is cumbersome or difficult to set up and use • DME is fragile, not rugged or tough • Continual Hg dropping becomes costly • Hg can air oxidize and the oxide can clog the capillary tube where the drop forms • Mercury is toxic and slightly volatile, and spills are almost inevitable, a good vacuum cleaner. (Keywords: oxidizing, cumbersome, fragile, costly, clog, toxic)
Modes of Transport of Electroactive Species to DME	1. By Convection, 2. By electrostatic attraction and 3. By diffusion.
How transport occurs by convection	By mechanical stirring or by heating, as it increases current increases. 
How transport occurs by electrostatic attraction	 Attraction between positive species and the negative cathode. The current produced here is known as migration current. 
How does transport occur by diffusion?	i. occurs due to the concentration gradient of ions, ii. The rate of mass transport by diffusion depends on the concentration and the diffusion coefficient (a constant value characteristic for the analyte) iii. the transport (current) will depend on concentration. Small ion conc small inflexion of curve high ion conc large inflexion of curve in polarographic analysis the mode of mass transport should be only by diffusion.
Relation between Diffusion current and Thickness of diffusion layer	Diffusion current ∞ 1/ Thickness of diffusion layer
How to minimize convection?	Convection can be prevented by: i. avoiding stirring, ii. controlling the temperature, iii. adding gelatin to increase the viscosity of the medium.  
How to minimize electrostatic attraction?	It can be minimized by: i. adding a large excess of inert electrolyte (not reducible) known by supporting electrolyte (50-100 times more than analyte concentration)
Faradaic current	 • When the potential applied to the working electrode exceeds the reduction potential of the electroactive species, a reduction will take place at the electrode surface • Thus, electroactive species diffuse from the bulk solution to the electrode surface and the reduction products diffuse from the electrode surface towards the bulk solution. This creates what is called the faradaic current. Another definition: The current resulting from redox reaction at the working and auxiliary electrodes is called farradic current.
Non-Faradaic current	• Nonfaradaic current occurs whenever the electrode's potential is changed. • When mass transport takes place by migration, negatively charged particles in solution migrate toward a positively charged electrode, and positively charged particles move away from the same electrode. • When an inert electrolyte is responsible for migration, it forms a structured electrode-surface interface called the electrical double layer, or EDL, • The movement of charged particles in solution, gives rise to a short-lived, nonfaradaic charging current. • Changing the potential of an electrode causes a change in the structure of the EDL, producing a small charging current. 
Summarise the non-faradic current about when it takes place: changing electrode potential, when mass transport takes place by migration when inert electrolyte is responsible for migration, and movement of charged particles.

B: Decomposition potential potential Once exceeded, reduction begins. B-C: An increase in volt is accompanied by an increase in current (diffusion current). C: maximum limiting value, the point after which there is no increase in current by increase of potential. C-D: concentration polarization, when the rate of electron transfer is maximum and the current is maximum. E: half-wave potential, the potential is the point on the polarographic wave where the current is equal to one-half the diffusion current is termed the half-wave potential and is designated by E1/2.
Residual current	is the combination of currently produced by the reduction of impurities and the Helmholtz double layer. Ir = If + Ic 
Diffusion current	occurs due to the diffusion of analytes. It depends on the concentration.
How to calculate diffusion current?	According to Ilkovic equation, img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhMEu9tNmEzCDKDawlLd8OiaHW4X1YpIdOfbHA0jmP_cB83FBXNDoo12kvaFC0PcERBPFyUQj03oXXQ73VlStPjskRwYTdpWkrqNlgMVfXl_JK2CEZV-p-BlGIPnLaIjcBtqkKnWZGfmYSNPnermSnXmbgt1MeIt58uZQ4J8NFHlXT7r5YL02ceNfCWwwhT)
Relation between current and diffusion rate	• Current is proportional to the rate of diffusion, which is proportional to [C]o - [C]s; where the [C]o and [C]s are the concentrations in the bulk solution and at the electrode surface.
At a sufficiently negative potential, what happens to the diffusion current?	The reduction is so fast that the [C]s << [C]o and the relation becomes Limiting current = diffusion current, which is proportional to [C]o
At point C what important incidence occurs?	The rate of supply of the cadmium ions from the main bulk of the solution to the working electrode surface has become equal to the rate of their deposition. In short: The supply of cadmium ions becomes equal to the rate of their deposition.
If the potential is more negative than D, what happens?	At potentials more negative than point D, the concentration of undischarged cadmium ions at the micro-electrode surface is negligibly small relative to the cadmium ion concentration in the bulk solution. In short: The quantity of cadmium is negligible at the micro-electrode.
The rate of reduction is controlled by 	the rate of diffusion.
What is Half-wave potential?	The potential at the midpoint of the steeply (sharply) rising portion of the curve. 
Factors affecting Diffusion current	1. Ilkovic equation. 2. Complexation of a metal ion decreases the diffusion current. 3. Diffusion current depends upon several factors, such as temperature, viscosity of the medium, composition of the base electrolyte, molecular or ionic state of the electroactive species, dimension of the capillary and pressure on the dropping mercury.
Why E1/2 is used as qualitative analysis?	It is characteristic of each substance under specific conditions and is thus used for qualitative analysis. Moreover, E1/2 is independent of the conc. of electroactive species.

Maxima Suppressor	Gelatin, Triton X-100
How suppressor work?	 Suppressors probably form an adsorbed layer on the aqueous side of the mercury solution interface. This prevents the streaming movement of the diffusion layer at the interface.

Maxima of the first kind	 In dilute solutions of supporting electrolytes, these maxima is usually observed on the rising portion of the polarographic wave. Streaming of the solution around the electrode surface causes this maxima.
Maxima of the second kind	It is observed in concentrated solutions of the supporting electrolyte (above 0.1 N). It appears on the limiting current region. The occurrence of a maximum of the second kind depends on the mercury flow rate.
Effect of dissolved oxygen	It interferes with the determination of most metal ions.
How dissolved oxygen affect?	Oxygen is an electroreducible species its presence in solution produces a double wave (approximately equal height) reducing at the DME in the range of 0 to –1V (extending over a considerable voltage range) due to reduction reaction. This wave interferes with the analyte wave. img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiZ3POiTXo9az5QLyaOFwZdCPU3S8MH9b8NF33jAD3JzfoxefmI9moCjYA-NfHjePP3yUgwXrq-phylTx05H_NlGrx1L5nyGpExkY7QddXsa6PDEBeH32V0rdP_Mj-sslWa-VF0qP6VzsnOAlTCFUxq-5SPN70dAlUOmlVtoEtdZDH4XLvRqRZGWURMGb76)
