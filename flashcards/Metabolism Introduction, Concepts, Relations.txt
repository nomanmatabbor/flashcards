Metabolism	the sum of all the chemical transformations taking place in a cell or organism occurs through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that constitute metabolic pathways.
Metabolism Concepts	involves coordinated cellular activities where multienzyme systems work together to (1) capture energy from the environment (solar energy), (2) convert nutrients into the cell's own molecules, (3) form macromolecules, and (4) synthesize and degrade biomolecules for specialized functions. Central metabolic pathways, few in number and similar across life forms, are a major focus. Organisms are classified based on the chemical form through which they obtain carbon from the environment.
Autotrophs	can use CO2 from the atm. <br>Autotrophs, like photosynthetic bacteria and plants, use atmospheric carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source to build biomolecules. Some, like cyanobacteria, can also utilize atmospheric nitrogen for nitrogenous components.
Heterotrophs	can not use CO2 from the atm but use relatively complex organic molecules like glucose.  <br>Heterotrophs, including multicellular animals and most microorganisms, cannot use atmospheric carbon dioxide and must acquire carbon from complex organic molecules in their environment, such as glucose. Autotrophs are self-sufficient, while heterotrophs rely on other organisms for carbon in more complex forms.

Catabolism	is the degradative phase of metabolism in which organic nutrient molecules (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) are converted into smaller, simpler end products (such as lactic acid, CO2, and NH3).
Anabolism	also called biosynthesis, small, simple precursors are built up into larger and more complex molecules, including lipids, polysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids. Anabolic reactions require an input of energy, generally in the form of the phosphoryl group transfer potential of ATP and the reducing power of NADH, NADPH, and FADH2

How do living cells obtain and use energy, and what are the key principles of bioenergetics and thermodynamics in biological systems?	Living cells use bioenergetics to study energy relationships. Key principles involve enthalpy (H) and entropy (S) in reactions, with ∆G as the net driving force. ∆G′° is a constant derived from Keq, and ∆G depends on ∆G′° and concentrations. A large, negative ∆G favours the forward reaction, positive favours the reverse, and ∆G = 0 is equilibrium. Notably, free-energy changes are pathway-independent and additive in reactions with a common intermediate. Free-energy,<br>∆G = ∆H − T ∆S<br><br>Actual free-energy, <br>∆G = ∆G′° + RT ln ([products]/[reactants])

ATP properties	The energy source of cells(known as the “energy currency” of the cell) Used for muscular contractions, enzyme activity etc. Catabolism results in the production of many ATP molecules: Energy Used by the body when energy is needed Hydrolysis breaks the bond in ATP, thus releasing energy Food energy is converted to ATP with approximately 50% efficiency The other 50% is released as heat
NADH stands for 	"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) + hydrogen (H)." It occurs naturally in the body and plays a role in generating energy. The NADH produced by the body is involved in making energy in the body.

Chemical Logic and Common Biochemical Reactions 	Living systems make use of a large number of chemical reactions that can be classified into five general types. These are: (1) reactions that make or break carbon-carbon bonds; (2) internal rearrangements, isomerisations, and eliminations; (3) free-radical reactions; (4) group transfers; and (5) oxidation-reductions
