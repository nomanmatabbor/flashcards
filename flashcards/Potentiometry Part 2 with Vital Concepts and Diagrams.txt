Potentiometry Part 2	Here we will learn deeply about potentiometry. This is very important in analytical chemistry.
Another name for membrane indicator electrode	Ion-selective electrode
What are the requirements of a membrane? 	1. Solubility: Minimal solubility – solids, semi-solids and polymer. 2. Conductivity: Some electrical conductivity. 3. Reactivity: Selective reactivity with the analyte
Write down the types of membrane indicator electrodes. 	1. Crystalline: Single crystal (LaF3 for F-), Polycrystalline or mixed crystal (Ag2S for S2- and Ag+). 2. Noncrystalline: Glass (silicate glasses for H+, Na+), Liquid (liquid ion exchange for Ca2+)
Write the components of polymer membrane electrodes	Composed of a polymer such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a plasticizer, and the ion carrier or exchanger.
What are the characteristics of polymer membrane electrodes?	The response of these electrodes is highly selective and they have replaced many liquid membrane electrodes.
What are the applications of polymer membrane electrodes? 	Polymer electrodes have been used to determine ions such as K+, Ca2+, Cl- and NO3-
Example of polymer membrane electrode	Crown ether, valinomycin(very selective for K+) img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/crown%20ether%20and%20valinomycin.png)
Ag/AgCl electrode principle	The Ag/AgCl electrode is a reference electrode, which means it provides a stable and known reference potential. It is commonly used in combination with other electrodes (e.g., a glass electrode) to form a complete electrochemical cell for measurements.
Glass electrode principle	The glass membrane is selective to hydrogen ions and allows them to pass through, generating a potential difference across the membrane. This potential is related to the pH of the solution. The glass electrode is commonly used in pH meters for measuring the acidity or alkalinity of a solution in combination with a reference electrode such as the Ag/AgCl electrode or Calomel electrode.
How can we measure the pH of a solution using different electrodes?	We can measure the pH of a solution in two typical ways: 1. Glass electrode and saturated calomel electrode as a reference electrode. 2. Glass electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as reference electrode.
pH electrode	Combination of the glass electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode or combination of the glass electrode and saturated calomel electrode. In modern laboratories and industries, the trend is toward using Ag/AgCl electrodes or other non-mercury alternatives as reference electrodes due to safety and environmental concerns. 
Draw the electrode system for measuring pH using a calomel and glass electrode.	Here is the electrode system for measuring pH using calomel and glass electrode: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/glass%20electrode%20and%20calomel%20electrode%20to%20measure%20pH.png)
Draw the combined glass electrode with the Ag/AgCl reference electrode to measure pH.	Here is the combined glass electrode with Ag/AgCl reference electrode to measure pH: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/combined%20ag%20agcl%20electrode%20and%20glass%20electrode%20to%20measure%20pH.png)
Write down the cell notation of the glass electrode with the calomel electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode cell for the measurement of pH.	Using both a saturated calomel electrode (Ref electrode 1) and a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrode (Ref electrode 2) in conjunction with a glass electrode for pH measurements is less common in modern practice. Typically, one of these reference electrodes is chosen for use with the glass electrode. However, here the cell notation of these three electrodes is given below: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/glass%20electrode%20and%20two%20reference%20electrode%20to%20measure%20pH.png)
Write down the composition of the glass membrane.	Consists of approximately 22% Na2O, 6% CaO, and 72% SiO2.
What are the characteristics of glass membranes?	1. Membranes made from this glass exhibit excellent specificity to hydrogen ions up to a pH of about 9. 2. At higher pH values, however, the glass becomes somewhat responsive to sodium as well as to other singly charged cations.
Some recent advancements in glass membranes.	 Sodium and calcium ions are replaced to various degrees by barium and lithium ions. These membranes have superior selectivity and lifetime.
Write down the structure of the glass membrane and show the structure.	Membrane structure of silicate glass: 1. SiO4- frame with charge balancing cations (positive change, mnemonic: cation have plus like t, that means cation is positive). 2. Singly charged cations, such as sodium and lithium, can move around in the lattice and are responsible for electrical conduction within the membrane. img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/silicate%20glass%20membrane%20structure.png)
Why do need membrane of glass surfaces to be hydrated?	Because non-hydrated glass surfaces show no pH as no ion exchange occurs. When the surface is hydrated or in aqueous condition, an ion exchange reaction at the surface occurs by singly charged cations in the interstices of the glass lattice and hydrogen ions from the solution. Here are the reactions that take place in the membrane: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/role%20of%20hydration%20of%20glass%20surface.png)
How to calculate boundary potential? Show with equation.	Eb is the boundary potential which varies with the pH of the analyte solution. Showing calculation with the equation: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/boundary%20potential%20calculation.png)
What is the function of a glass electrode?	To develop boundary potential. The source of two potentials E1 and E2 is the charge that accumulates as a consequence of the reactions. img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/glass%20surface%20reaction%20in%20glass%20membrane.png) These two reactions cause the two glass surfaces to be negatively charged with respect to the solutions with which they are in contact. img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/two%20potential%20in%20glass%20surface.png) These negative charges at the surfaces produce the two potentials E1 and E2. 
Difference between glass electrode and metallic electrode	The boundary potential depends only on the proton activity, whereas the metallic electrode potential depends on analyte solutions' nature and other factors.
What is asymmetry potential?	When identical solutions and reference electrodes are placed on the two sides of a glass membrane, the boundary potential should in principle be zero. Frequently, however, we find a small asymmetry potential that changes gradually with time.
Why does asymmetry potential cause?	Because of: (Mnemonic: SEA) 1. difference in <b>strain</b> on the two surfaces of the membrane created during manufacture, 2.mechanical <b>abrasion</b> (friction) on the outer surface during use and 3. chemical <b>etching</b> of the outer surface. So electrode must be calibrated before use.
Write an equation for the potential of the glass electrode using a glass indicator electrode.	img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/calculation%20of%20potential%20of%20glass%20electrode%20using%20glass%20indicator%20electrode.png)
Sources of uncertainty in pH measurement with glass-electrode	Alkaline error, acid error, 
What is alkaline error and its effect?	Alkaline error: In the basic solution, the glass electrode responds to the conc. of both H+ ions and alkali metal ions. Effect: Because of alkaline error, glass electrodes's selectivity is lost. Here is the error shown in a graph with the reaction that takes place in the glass electrode surface during alkaline error. img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/alkaline%20error%20in%20graph.png)
What are the alkaline error effects in potential?	The effect of alkali metal ions on the potential across the membrane can be accounted for by the equation, img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/alkaline%20error%20in%20potential.png)
What is the selectivity coefficient?	Selectivity coefficient (KH.B): This is a measure of the response of an ion-selective electrode to another ion. The range of selectivity coefficients is typically greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1. A value of 1 indicates perfect selectivity, meaning that the electrode only responds to the primary ion and is not affected by the presence of other ions. Values less than 1 indicate some level of interference from other ions.
What is the acid error?	When less H+ ion is detected by the glass membrane. Less H+ ion detection means a higher pH value. So, because of this error, pH read˃ pH true occurs.
Write the characteristics of ISE (ion selective electrode).	1. Potential developed at the indicator electrode that contains information about the amount of analyte in a sample. 2. During the measurement, there is little to no current flow. 3. It provides a high degree of selectivity. 3. The selectivity of the ISE is determined by the composition of the membrane. 4. Redox processes do not occur at ISEs.
How does potential develop in ISE?	The potential developed at the membrane is the result of either an ion exchange process or an ion transport process occurring at each interface between the membrane and solution. The charge separation at each interface results in a phase-boundary potential. This potential is present till the concentration of analyte on each side of the membrane is zero. 
How many ways potential can be developed in ISE?	Potential can be developed in two ways depending on ISE: 1. By Ion exchange. 2. By Ionophore

Diagram of ionophore in ISE that develops potential:	Here ion transport occurs with an ionophore. The ionophore cannot diffuse out of the membrane but can “trap” the analyte ion (A+) at the interface between the solution and membrane. img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiydFtMfJux0FwBQNg_PKCInWbO89RaNirJ18F84FntZtt_6rYqqZ_APil6EE9rt8OzQblPy_O4dpHe7jJ_XSaSrD775ys_iT3mRtbRsY4fFa-rLHc2dQ-WsjEbxjCCNZZwIKGgLRjvWCy8FRtJNvwAZchVDRKZW7nrgCIkJJQ7PwQ_ha48DQvth82qmmGC)

37. What are the advantages of ISE?	➢ Direct measurement of a wide range of ions ➢ More precise ➢ Cheap and good response ➢ High efficiency and short response time 
What are the disadvantages of ISE?	➢ It is unreliable at low concentrations (10^-4 M) ➢ Inability to measure below 2-3 ppm solution ➢ Interference by other ions present in the solution ➢ An electrode is fragile (brittle or weak) and has a limited shelf life ➢ The electrode can be fouled by protein and other organic solutes
What is direct potentiometry?	Direct potentiometry is a technique used in analytical chemistry to measure the concentration of an ion in a solution by determining the potential difference between a reference electrode and an ion-selective electrode. 
Show direct potentiometry with equation	As direct potentiometry is related to the reference electrode and ion-selective electrode, the equation is the following, img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj_Ks3n_qnrg4sTB-eV-ppCDO36XAD0lyiupfst7UmRi9ZsmcgzAaVJpH6cx2fymRNuXCT50z3SH_8zsN5M7VRjoNIbLHOROBfe5mO2skriL90nbV5TXEzhP5O_kbAYUcMwFsTWMLxBHuEa7w5OBbBwq2wPqrJi2nsUy6RW4yfuzs5jbVa41tyQ4cCjSP3D) img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiKZBMP1tTRkdCeSeI-LeOWawd6_SBv7-qyyzeKZgFalMHfc5zvUqDaOOHeKizAatdbtXZIEN56mHQOUq2Pi7JWro-_YOHhXCurM1u90_Am033QD0MX73ZVnnH4hImGewxRE1GhWTGewfA1CjWgZAOO4QcJiZ7FI7MoJPgeWzfjm9eZ4OC2JBcTgvZ44Hoe)
39. Write the general terms of the electrode calibration method.	✓ The calibration is normally performed at the time pX or pA for the unknown is determined. ✓ With membrane electrodes, recalibration may be required if measurements extend over several hours because of slow changes in the asymmetry potential. img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjXcjhDlfLYgIkRhqqp8-Lkls61ilZFvp1fSb8UuqUukYJwC-5BDhcIDXFMbukQFexkDEs8UL3aCYrTN4LylI4l5ik8L-pf3wQljt_6BESgWnmkh4ZyjBZNjKGbwmhE6jl_ymvjmC6R9O6W5F_zJVF2-ALjC6NcieVbmsJANSLMHUyi2h6pP68X5k81OqsG) ✓ The nonlinearity is due to the increase in ionic strength—and the consequent decrease in the activity of ion—with increasing electrolyte concentration. ✓ For potentiometric measurements from activity to concentration it is necessary to make the ionic composition of the standards essentially the same as that of the analyte solution. 
The fault of the electrode-calibration method	❖ A serious disadvantage or fault is the inherent error that results from the assumption that K in Equations remains constant after calibration.
40. How does potentiometric titration work? 	It works by measuring the potential of a suitable indicator electrode as a function of titrant volume.
Advantages of potentiometric titration	▪ Potentiometric titrations provide data that are more reliable than data from titrations that use chemical indicators. ▪ Particularly useful with coloured or turbid solutions and for detecting the presence of unsuspected species. ▪ Potentiometric titrations have been automated in a variety of different ways
