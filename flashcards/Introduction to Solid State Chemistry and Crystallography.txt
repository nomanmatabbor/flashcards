Solid State Chemistry and Crystallography
Scope of Solid State Chemistry	studies about solid materials, their synthesis, properties and structures (crystal, electronic).
Application of Solid State Chemistry	new material synthesis, drug design, catalysis and energy storage calculation
Techniques in Solid State Chemistry	X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and spectroscopy
Scope of Crystallography	Determination of 3D atomic arrangements in crystal
Application of Crystallography	drug discovery and material design, molecular structure elucidation
Techniques	X-ray crystallography

Isotropic means	Various physical properties such as conductivity, refractive index, thermal expansion etc. are the same in all directions.
Anisotropic means	Various physical properties such as conductivity, refractive index, thermal expansion etc. are not the same in all directions.
Characteristics of liquid crystals	1. Molecules are arranged orderly but lack long-range order.<br>2. exist in different phases like cholesteric, and nematic.<br>3. unique optical interaction. <br>4. Mainly in screens like TVs and phones.<br>5. Optical orientation changes by controlled temperature and electric fields.
