Drugs	Application<br>Formulation<br>Mechanism of treating
Sulfa drugs	Application: bacterial infections<br>Formulation: parent compound is sulfanilamide, p-aminobenzenesulfonamide img(https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/structures/285/404/00dc97cb-41e2-420f-b328-03d5d318f549/640/00dc97cb-41e2-420f-b328-03d5d318f549.png)<br>Mechanism of treating: arrest the growth of bacteria by preventing the formation of folic acid. img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiVlPfLny1BVdDPHg1KSRfAveX4untPYGrZ2Ps-EuwJrnhuOWtPANmMTYS0FW34zAZJdhB_dG9hRZpvFWK3WulM4m7wtEPj1lCl8qUajShOzi0Wrl5CiBW6h2UbRdfV_3iyGYa2Ay8kv13tmuy4wAC-la1DCj34__WZprP2eDiTO3-zBMBWiZdbf5eNnAGn)<br>The acid comes from p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) that have to combine with an enzyme. As we know, PABA and sulfonilamide have similar structures, sulfonilamide binds to enzymes and prevents PABA from forming folic acid. img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjWT7E9kz8Sk9t8rKOCrNbRwxZdJa7kthgxXj89vFASF-r-ELWufnWnrJpn2xI56OY4j0CCwf_Oco6IHzjEXvaudrxMpTPGpTtE-uT_RaKgiV-Xg-NiORTnUhenJD1Z3MqKcqO7qTNF8J4yBjLP4MaI-Le-BNX423zxX5cG_pXGoLtVK4RMVyUYco97uCoR)
Salicylic acid, aspirin, paracetamol	Application: pain killer<br>Formulation: Salicylic acid is destructive to tissues, so its phenolic hydrogen is replaced by an acetyl group that forms acetylsalicylic acid also familiar as aspirin. But it's hydrolysis causes acidity in the stomach.<br>img(https://i.imgur.com/yhThJiu.png)<br>It's excessive usage cause ulcer. So another drug named paracetamol is safe to use. But it may also cause liver damage.<br>img(https://i.imgur.com/jH145uF.png)<br>Mechanism of treating img(https://i.imgur.com/OAsRa1t.png)
Narcotic analgesics	Application: It causes central nervous system depression, even to the point of sleep. Only D isomers are active. <br>Formulation: Morphine, codeine, heroin, methadone, these all are in this class. The first three are derivatives of morphine while the last one is not. <br>img(https://i.imgur.com/5MW6cNN.png)<br>Mechanism of treating: Their action occurs with receptor sites located in the brain. The receptor site has a shape into which only D-isomers can fit in order to make the necessary contact for the drug to be active. 
Pentapeptide	Application: nervous system dippression<br>Formulation: img(https://i.imgur.com/MpERUCb.png)<br>Mechanism of treating: similar to methadone and morphine img(https://i.imgur.com/ai9Mlzh.png)
Antagonists: Antihistamine (important), Desloratadine, Fexofenadine, Bilastine	Application: Mitigation of Allergy, counteract the effect of histamine.<br>Formulation: antihistamin structure is important <br>img(https://i.imgur.com/TIwmBWb.png) img(https://i.imgur.com/WbsUUjY.png)<br>Mechanism of treating: Prevents histamines from working by occupying their receptor sites, known as H<sub>1</sub> sites. Drugs that are used to treat allergies are called antagonists.
Causes of Allergy	Biological decarboxylation of Histidine forms Histamine that stimulates (excites) nerve endings and dilates (increases) skin vessels which results in pain and itching.<br>img(https://i.imgur.com/PRYLDXf.png)<br>
Antimalarial drugs	Application: malaria elimination<br>Formulation: Three ways: 1. elimination of the vector, 2. drug therapy, 3. vaccination<br>Mechanism of treating: drug therapy, quinine, chloroquine, pamaquine
Structure of Chloroquine and primaquine	img(https://i.imgur.com/Rs1q52m.png)
General Anesthetics drugs	<br>Application: make senseless<br>Formulation or example: cyclopropane, haloethane, nitrous oxide, chloroform, and diethyl ether<br>Mechanism of treating: The brain is rich in lipids. All general anaesthetics are more soluble in lipids than in blood, allowing them to reach the brain by inhaling.
Local anaesthetics	Application: to do the little operation, Cocaine is sometimes used for eye surgery  <br>Formulation or example: procaine, benzocaine, cocaine<br>Mechanism of treating: block nerve conduction img(https://i.imgur.com/XsDiiSx.png)
Show local anaesthetics in normal and infected tissue	R3N is the local anaesthetics common name. It is basic in nature so forming salt in affected tissue is acidic. img(https://i.imgur.com/xVU71cK.png)
Antibiotics 	Antibiotics, also known as antibacterials, are types of medications that destroy or slow down the growth of bacteria
How do antibiotics work? important	 Although there are a number of different types of antibiotic they all work in one of two ways: 1. A bactericidal antibiotic kills the bacteria. Penicillins and cephalosporins are bactericidal. A bactericidal usually either interferes with the formation of the bacterium's cell wall or its cell contents. 2. A bacteriostatic antibiotic stops bacteria from multiplying. Aminoglycosides, macrolides, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are bacteriostatic.
What are antibiotics for?	 An antibiotic is given for the treatment of an infection caused by bacteria. Antibiotics target microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and parasites. However, they are not effective against viruses. If you have an infection it is important to know whether it is caused by bacteria or a virus. Most upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold and sore throats are generally caused by viruses − antibiotics do not work against these viruses.

Structural Features of Penicillins	β-lactam antibiotics are composed of a dipeptide of cysteine and valine. An intact β-lactam ring is essential for activity. Variation of the side chain improved the activity against gram-negative bacteria compared to Penicillin G.
