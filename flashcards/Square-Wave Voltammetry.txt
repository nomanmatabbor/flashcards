Square-wave voltammetry	large amplitude
reverse pulse means	 reverse reaction
The waveform applied to the working electrode 	is a symmetric square wave superimposed on a base staircase potential
Current is sampled twice during	 each square-wave cycle: One at the end of the forward pulse (i1) and one at the end of the reverse pulse (i2)

modulation amplitude	is very large
The net current (i1 â€“ i2) is plotted versus	 the base staircase potential
the voltammogram is 	a peak-shaped voltammogram
The peak-shaped voltammogram is symmetric about the	 half-wave potential
Peak current is proportional	 to the concentration
The net current is larger than	 the forward or reverse currents img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjKMKszZS3uprC3RcFg7PtU2ipJrIS0RbwwhLtN7kVWw40l4-qChFRImlWIH1xfQ-9ZuMhGdSATseJz_wR56Jha4QrBjTTOqbzlVVxW5JbEaDAqjASxUDnW0iN1aMGzGKr-buonPvxQC8cLKg5HfkPMWbdtoey9fkpfoki2kutU1ShW974z_SRG1tmwpovy)
Higher sensitivity than 	differential-pulse in which reverse current is not used
for reversible systems currents	 4 times higher
for irreversible systems,	currents are 3.3 times higher 
Low detection limits 	up to 10-8 M
major advantage 	 speed, complete voltammogram can be recorded within a couple of seconds
advantageous in 	batch and flow analytical operations, 
can resolve 	neighboring peaks in chromatography and capillary electrophoresis
Reduced analysis time	 due to higher scan rates (few seconds compared to ~3 minutes for differential pulse)
The entire voltammogram is recorded on a	 single mercury drop
SWV may be used for 	kinetic studies
