Major processes of drug action	three phases: 1. Pharmaceutical phase, 2. Pharmacokinetic phase, Pharmacodynamic phase
The pharmaceutical phase	This phase encompasses the period from the administration of a drug substance, usually in the form of a tablet or capsule, to its release into the body fluids. A typical tablet contains a small percentage of the active component, along with diluents, binders, and disintegration agents. The goal is to ensure rapid breakdown under physiological conditions, although there are cases where a slow, sustained release is preferred. The focus of this phase is on achieving optimal pharmaceutical availability of the active principle.
The pharmacokinetic phase	In the pharmacokinetic phase, the active principle released from a pharmaceutical formulation travels through the body to its target tissue. Absorption into the bloodstream occurs within about four minutes, and the drug passes through membranes, including complex ones in the brain. In the bloodstream, it can bind to proteins and undergo metabolic processes. While distributed throughout the body, only a small fraction is available for binding to the target structure. The target tissue may not be directly associated with the response tissue. The primary objective in this phase is assessing the biological availability of the active principle.
The pharmacodynamic phase	In the pharmacodynamic phase, the drug interacts with its receptor site, typically a membrane protein, initiating a biological response. Medicinal chemistry focuses on maximizing therapeutic effects while minimizing undesired effects. The drug must be eliminated from the body to prevent toxicity, relying on metabolic processes. The chemotherapeutic index (Therapeutic index) is expressed as: <br>Chemotherapeutic index = 𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒 /𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑡𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒<br> Therapeutic index = LD50/ED50<br>Where LD50 is the lethal dose to kill 50% of test animals, and ED50  is the dose producing an effective therapeutic response in 50% of test animals. A larger therapeutic index indicates a greater margin of safety.
Flow chart of the pharmaceutical phase	Administer Drug → Pharmaceutical Formulation (Tablet/Capsule) → Release into Body Fluids → Tablet Composition: 5-10% Active Principle, 80% Diluent, Binder, etc. → Agents for Rapid Disintegration → Evaluate Pharmaceutical Availability
Flow chart of the pharmacokinetic phase	Administer Drug → Release into Body → Transport to Target Tissue → Distribution in Body → Reach Target → Trigger Stimulus → Biochemical Events → Pharmacological Response → Assess Biological Availability
Flow chart of pharmacodynamic phase	Drug-Receptor Interaction → Biological Response Initiation → Tissue Response & Optimization → Drug Elimination → Metabolism & Excretion → Variation in Process Time → Impact of Water Solubility & Lipophilicity → Biological Effect Optimization → Absorption, Metabolism, Excretion Cycle → Cellular Membrane Interaction → Therapeutic Effect & Side Effects → Chemotherapeutic & Therapeutic Index Calculation → Safety Margin Assessment → End
