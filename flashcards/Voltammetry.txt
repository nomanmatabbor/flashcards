Read first	Polarographic basic
Limitation of DC polarography	1. Can't measure less than 10^-5 M analyte conc.
If two components have 0.2 V half-wave potential difference	they can't be detected by DC polarography
This is due to 	the condenser current associated with the charging of each mercury drop as it forms
To overcome this problem 	We have to do (a) pulse polarography (b) rapid scan polarography (c) sinusoidal a.c. polarography (d) stripping analysis
To solve the condenser's current issue who made an effort	Barker and Jenkin
How they did do it?	• By application of the potential in a series of pulses; • One pulse of approximately 0.05-second duration being applied during the growth of a mercury drop, and • At a fixed point near the end of the life of the drop. • Two different procedures be employed: (a) pulses of increasing amplitude may be superimposed upon a constant d.c. potential, or (b) pulses of constant amplitude may be applied to a steadily increasing d.c. potential img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhvDXkJnhIdMmlsZz_WlNKpgmczWkYhW3oCRbt-hcOLPziM6VheQxY7hVbxqp9I7Gv5NWwb6ahx9fES4ydBevdh2zQmjyVW_hoyRlOx5PUKULMTQcGE2lgKdZhitdgzpCwDLb_s9L2bP6yUgOHvWjR-izvCrpvJqwvFH9rIngz-xgAzfdc6a8cKEMjjCUfy)
Pulse amplitude	height of the potential pulse
Pulse width	duration of the pot pulse
sample period	time at the end of the pulse during which the current is measured
potential cycle calculated from 	pulse period and drop time
Pulse voltammetry is a 	voltammetry technique which makes use of potential pulse
potential steps having a duration of about 	50 ms, 
steps are applied to the 	working electrode
After each potential step- charging current and faradaic current decays 	rapidly exponentially to a negligible value and slowly 
observed current excludes 	charging current, as it is late in pulse life
detection time of pulse voltammetry 	low- 10^-8 M levels
There are different pulse voltammetric techniques based on	 the excitation waveform and the current sampling regime
These are 	- Normal-Pulse Voltammetry, - Reverse-Pulse Voltammetry, - Differential-PulseVoltammetry, - Square-Wave Voltammetry, - Staircase Voltammetry
NPV (Normal-Pulse Volatemtry)	one potential pulse is applied for each drom of mercury using DME, increasing amplitude applied to successive drops, Electrode is kept at a base potential between pulses at which no reaction occurs, Base potential is kept constant
NPV Pulse amplitude increases	 linearly
npv Current is measured about	 40 ms after each pulse is applied
npv Diffusion layer is 	thinner than that of DC polarography due to the short pulse duration
npv Higher faradaic current	 than DC polarography
npv Voltammogram has a 	sigmoidal shape

npv Comparison with dc polarography	5-10 times more sensitive, advantageous for solid electrodes, diffusion layer is thinner due to short pulse duration, higher faradic current, zero charging current.
