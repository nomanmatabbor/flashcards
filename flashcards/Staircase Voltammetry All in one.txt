Useful for rejecting	 background charging current
Potential-time waveform involves successive potential steps of height and duration 	 ~10 mV height and ~50 ms duration
Current is measured 	at the end of each step where the charging current is negligible (has decayed)
The peak-shaped current response is similar	 to that of linear scan experiments (considered as a digital version of linear scan)
The voltammetric response is similar to 	cyclic voltammetry
Charging current contribution 	is much reduced
