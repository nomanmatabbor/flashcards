Enzymes	Enzymes are proteins that catalyse a specific biological chemical reaction and enhance the rate of a reaction by providing a reaction path with a lower activation energy. 
Why Are Enzymes So Important? 	Nearly all chemical reactions in biological cells need enzymes. Digesting one meal could take years without enzymes! Examples of digestive enzymes: are sucrase, lipase, and amylase.

They are remarkable biomolecules 	because of their extraordinary specificity and catalytic power, which are greater than those of man-made catalysts.
International classification of enzymes	img(https://i.imgur.com/yTojwEG.png)
Characteristics of enzymes	Mnemonic: SPACE<br>1. Catalysis: Enzymes are biological catalysts which bring about chemical reactions in the living cells.<br>2. Production: They are produced by the living organism, and are usually present in only very small amounts in the various cells (about 0.01%).<br>3. Activity: They can also exhibit their activity even when they have been extracted from their source.<br>4. Statistics: All enzymes are globular proteins, many have been identified and a large number have been obtained in crystalline form.

Oxidoreductases 	Transfer of electrons (hydride ions or H atoms)/Redox 
Transferases	Group transfer reactions
Hydrolases	Hydrolysis reactions (transfer of functional groups to water)
Lyases 	Cleavage of C—C, C—O, C—N, or other bonds by elimination, leaving double bonds or rings, or addition of groups to double bonds
Isomerases 	Transfer of groups within molecules to yield isomeric forms (isomerization)
Ligases	Formation of C—C, C—S, C—O, and C—N bonds by condensation reactions coupled to cleavage of ATP or similar cofactor
Structure of enzymes	Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary
Primary 	simply the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain img(https://i.imgur.com/U2LuXT2.png)
The secondary	three-dimensional form of local segments of proteins e.g. alpha helices, beta sheets img(https://i.imgur.com/6bpmrHu.png)
Tertiary	three-dimensional shape of a protein. Extra: The tertiary structure will have a single polypeptide chain "backbone" with one or more protein secondary structures, the protein domains. img(https://i.imgur.com/xhqnibR.png)
Quaternary	 refers to the number and arrangement of the protein subunits with respect to one another. e.g. haemoglobin and DNA polymerase. img(https://i.imgur.com/Ey701eU.png)
How enzymes work?	Enzymes are biological catalysts that work to speed up chemical reactions in living organisms. They do this by binding to specific molecules (substrates) at their active sites, lowering the activation energy required for the reaction. img(https://i.imgur.com/RnVyNZE.png)
Active Site of an Enzyme	The active site is a specific region on an enzyme's surface where a substrate molecule binds, initiating a chemical reaction.
Mechanism of enzyme action	Two theories: 1. Lock and key, 2. Induced fit
Lock and key theory	Action of an enzyme with a single substrate. In this analogy, the lock is the enzyme and the key is the substrate. Only the correctly sized key (substrate) fits into the keyhole (active site) of the lock (enzyme). This is also called Fischer's Template theory. img(https://i.imgur.com/DecXS2q.png)
Induced-fit theory	It is considered the more correct version. According to this theory, initially, the active site and the substrate are not perfect matches for each other. Rather, the substrate induces a change of shape in the enzyme.  It is also called Koshland's theory. img(https://i.imgur.com/t1dHFNr.png)
Enzyme-substrate complex theory	Here enzyme and substrate form a complex that immediately breaks down into the enzyme and the product. It is also called the Michaelis-Menten theory. img(https://i.imgur.com/5eHldh6.png)
Effect of temperature on enzyme action	1 to 2 degrees increase in temperature may introduce 10 to 20% while a degree increase may introduce 50 to 100%. However many enzymes are adversely affected by high temperatures. After a certain temperature, the activity of the enzyme gets denatured or down. For animal enzymes, 40 degrees is the optimum temperature. img(https://i.imgur.com/HCkwK7u.png)
Effect of pH on enzyme action	After a certain pH, the activity of the enzyme, goes down. img(https://i.imgur.com/pixu8UL.png)
Apoenzyme	Proteins(inactive)
Holoenzyme	apoenzyme + cofactor; This is the active part of enzyme.
Enzyme	Proteins
Cofactors	Nonproteins may be organic or inorganic(usually metal ions). Organic cofactors are either tightly bound or released free after reaction completion. If that is tightly bound, is called a prosthetic group. It is released and is called a coenzyme.
Prosthetic group	organic cofactor that is tightly bound to the enzyme after reaction completion.
Coenzymes	organic cofactor that releases free after reaction completion (contains carbon atoms) cofactors.

Enzyme inhibition	Two types: Competitive and Non-competitive
An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule	 that disrupts the normal reaction pathway between an enzyme and a substrate. Enzyme inhibitors prevent the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex and hence prevent the formation of a product.
Competitive Inhibition	involves a molecule, other than the substrate. The competitive inhibitor blocks the active site and thus prevents substrate binding.  As the inhibitor is in competition with the substrate, its effects can be reduced by increasing substrate concentration img(https://i.imgur.com/JpPWOuq.png)
Noncompetitive Inhibition	involves a molecule binding to a site other than the active site (an allosteric site). This causes a conformational change to the enzyme’s active site. As a result, the substrate can be bound. Here, increasing substrate levels cannot mitigate the inhibitor’s effect, the inhibitor is not in direct competition. img(https://i.imgur.com/wC8N2zE.png)
Why does cut fruit turn brown?	Because of the catechol oxidase enzyme. Catechol (colourless substance) in the presence of O2 and catechol oxidase enzyme converts into polyphenol (brown product). img(https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/chemical-structure-catechol-c6h6o2-3d-600nw-2360738579.jpg)
Factors That Influence Enzyme Activity	❑Temperature; ❑pH ❑Cofactors & Coenzymes ❑Inhibitors
Properties of coenzyme	1. enhance the action of enzyme, 2. but loosely bound to the enzyme and so can be separated easily by dialysis. 3. Coenzymes are heat stable, 4. lower molecular weight. 4. Most of the vitamins are coenzyme e.g. NADH, NADPH, FAD, 5. After reaction completion, the coenzyme is released from the apoenzyme and goes to some other reaction site.
