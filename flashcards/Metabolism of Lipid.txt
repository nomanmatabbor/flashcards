Metabolism of Lipid	All details, figures, reactions, and concepts will be discussed here.
What are the characteristics of lipids? 	hydrophobic, not polymer, energy, hydrolysis, non-covalent interactions.<br> ❑ Lipids are hydrophobic in nature due to the predominance of hydrocarbon chain (-CH2-CH2-CH2-) in their structure.<br>❑ Unlike the proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides, lipids are not polymer ❑ They are the chief storage form of energy, and they provide 6-fold(6-times) as much energy as an equivalent mass of glycogen ❑ Neutral lipids, upon hydrolysis produce glycerol and fatty acid ❑ Many lipids are amphipathic (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic) ❑ In aqueous environment, lipids associate by non-covalent interactions to form supramolecular structures such as monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles.
How are lipids important to our body?	They are the structural components of the cell membrane. They help provide energy and produce hormones in our bodies. They help in the proper digestion and absorption of food. They also play an important role in signalling.
Fat and lipid relation	fat is the sub-group of lipid 
How are lipids digested?	The enzyme lipase breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol (GF), which is facilitated by bile in the liver.
Metabolism refers to 	the set of chemical processes in a living organism that sustain life. It involves the conversion of nutrients into energy and the synthesis of molecules needed for growth, repair, and maintenance.
How are lipids metabolized?	Lipid metabolism involves the oxidation of fatty acids to generate energy to synthesize new lipids from smaller molecules. The metabolism of lipids is associated with carbohydrate metabolism as the products of glucose are converted into lipids.
5. How are lipids released in the blood? 	lipids are insoluble in water, they are carried to the bloodstream by lipoproteins which are water-soluble and can carry the lipids internally.
6. What are lipids made up of? 	a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid molecules that is triglyceride
7. What is the classification of lipids?	FRCS: Fatti acids, Requirements, Chemical composition, Sources (biological significance)
Classification Based on the Chemical Composition	1. Simple Lipids: Fatty Acid, Triglycerides, Waxes 2. Compound Lipids: Phospholipids, Glycolipids, Lipoproteins 3. Derived Lipids: Steroids, Eicosanoids
Classification Based on Fatty Acids	1. Saturated Fatty Acids: lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, behenic, and lignoceric acids, 2.Unsaturated Fatty Acids: linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid
Classification Based on Requirements by the Human Body	1. Essential Fatty Acids: linoleic acid, linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid 2. Non-essential Fatty Acids: palmitic acid, oleic acid, and butyric acid 
Biological Significance of Lipids	 1. Chemical Messenger 2. Energy Storage 3. The Structural Component of the Cell Membrane
8. What is fatty acid? 	1. simplest form of lipids, 2. monocarboxylic, straight, unbranched, even number of carbon atoms (4 to 36). 3. acyl group when it is a part of ester, 4. amphipathic in nature, 5. fatty acid can be esterified with glycerol to form triglycerides.
unsaturated fatty acid	1. double bond, 2. liquid at room temp, 3. low melting point, 4. delta number system for double bond (del 9 means double bond at 9 no carbon), 5. oleic, palmitoleic, 6. natural- cis, fermented- trans.
Triglycerol	triester of fatty acid and glycerol, nonpolar, hydrophobic

types of triester	two types: single fatty acid (example on the above reaction), mixed fatty acid img(https://i.imgur.com/VEkaQbL.png)
Phospholipids	1. amphipathic, 2. vital structural component of the cell membrane, 3. can be broken down to their residue by the enzyme phosphatase which hydrolyses their fatty acids and phosphoric acid
Sterol	1. known as steroid alcohol, occurs naturally in plants, animals etc. e.g. cholesterol
Sterol types	1. Phytosterol- plant sterol. 2. Zoosterol - animal sterol. 3. Ergosterol - present in the cell membrane of fungi.
Phytosterol advantages	blocks cholesterol and reduces it in the human body
Lipid catabolism	Lipolysis. Lipase enzymes hydrolyze triacylglycerols releasing one fatty acid at a time producing diacylglycerols, and eventually glycerol. The end of the process is 3 fatty acids and 1 glycerol. img(https://i.imgur.com/v3AiJJB.png)
How does glycerol enter into glycolysis? 	img(https://i.imgur.com/hx38D2i.png)
How are fatty acids activated and transported into the mitochondrial matrix?	In animal cells, the enzymes of fatty acid oxidation are located in the mitochondrial matrix. So fatty acid should enter into the matrix. The fatty acids with chain lengths of 12 or fewer carbons enter mitochondria easily. The fatty acids with 14 C or more than 14 C chain cannot pass directly through the mitochondrial membranes. For this they have to undergo the 3 enzymatic reactions of the carnitine shuttle.<br>1. They convert themselves into fatty acyl-CoA in ctosole.<br>2. Then the fatty acyl-CoA converts into fatty acyl-carnitine in the outer mitochondrial membrane.<br>3. Finally, the fatty acyl-carnitine is enzymatically transferred from carnitine to intramitochondrial coenzyme A by carnitine acyltransferase II

Catabolism of fatty acid	conversion of fatty acid to a 1-acetyl-CoA
Steps of catabolism of fatty acid	1. Activation of fatty acid (by beta-oxidation), 2. Reaction with FAD to make unsaturation, 3. hydroxylation, 4. beta hydroxyl group will be oxidized by NAD+ (beta-oxidation of fatty acid). 5. now first turn acetyl-CoA splits off from the beta keto. with this, a new molecule of CoA attaches to the remaining fragment which has 2 fewer C atoms than the starting material. 6. depending on carbon numbers, further steps (2-5) will be repeated. Here beta oxidation requires 2 ATP investment for the first time only to attach CoA.
Reactions of catabolism of fatty acid	img(https://i.imgur.com/l3gHRcm.png) img(https://i.imgur.com/UfiI5jS.png)
Electron produced by 1 trun	1 turn produce 1 FADH2 and 1 NADH<br> 1 FADH2 = 2e- release; 1 NADH = 2e- release<br> Total = 4 e- for 1 turn
Electrons produced by 1 cycle (TCA)	1 cycle (TCA) produce 1 FADH2 and 3 NADH<br>1 FADH2 = 2e- release; 1 NADH = 2e- release<br>Total = 8 e- for 1 cycle (TCA)
ATP produced by 1 turn	4 ATP
ATP produced by 1 cycle (TCA)	12 ATP
How much ATP is produced by Hexanoic acid?	img(https://i.imgur.com/tPlxik7.png)<br>Adding the ATP from beta-oxidation and the TCA cycle: 8 ATP (beta-oxidation or from the fatty acid cycle)+36 ATP (TCA)=44 ATP 
Dodecanoic acid 	10 carbon

Show the β-Oxidation of Monounsaturated Fatty Acid.	 Oleic acid, as oleoyl-CoA (Δ9):  Oleoyl CoA undergoes three cycles of β-oxidation like normal saturated fatty acids to yield 3 molecules of acetyl CoA and results in the formation of 12-carbon fatty acyl-CoA with a cis double bond now between carbon 3 and 4. This product is known as cis-Δ<sup>3</sup>-Dodecenoyl-CoA. <br> The above product formed has a cis double bond and cannot further participate in β-oxidation. Thus by the action of Δ<sup>3</sup>,Δ<sup>2</sup>-enoyl-CoA isomerase, cisΔ<sup>3</sup>-Dodecenoyl-CoA is converted to trans-Δ<sup>2</sup>-Dodecenoyl-CoA. This is the significance of the isomerase enzyme in the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids. <br> trans-Δ<sup>2</sup>-Dodecenoyl-CoA now is acted upon by the enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway in five continuous cycles to yield another 6 molecules of acetyl CoA. <br>•The acetyl-CoA molecules now enter Kreb’s cycle.img(https://i.imgur.com/lxqSpfg.png)
