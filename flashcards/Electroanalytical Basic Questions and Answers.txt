Lesson: Electroanalytical basic	We will learn about various electrochemical cells, half cells and Nernst equations.
What is an Electrochemical cell?	Devices that produce electrical current from a chemical reaction(redox reaction).
Draw an electrochemical cell showing the flow of different ions and electrons with a salt bridge. And represent the cell diagram.	img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/Screenshot_212.png) Here, Zn is losing but Cupper is gaining.
The current will flow for an instant and then stop, what's the problem?	the net charge becomes greater, using the salt bridge, the net charge can be maintained at zero in both compartments. And the current flow will continue.
A salt bridge	is a device that provides passage of ions from one compartment to another without extensive mixing of the solutions and keeps the net charge zero in both compartments.
What is EMF?	The driving force is a push of electrons at the anode and attraction of electrons at the cathode. Electron flow occurs through the force. EMF is also reffered	as cell voltage.

Another name for the voltaic cell	galvanic cell, is the Daniel cell. Voltaic cells, galvanic cells, and the Daniell cell essentially refer to the same type of electrochemical cell. The terms are often used interchangeably. All of them involve converting chemical energy into electrical energy through redox reactions. A voltaic cell and a galvanic cell are general terms for electrochemical cells that generate an electric current through spontaneous chemical reactions. The Daniell cell, on the other hand, is a specific example of a galvanic cell that was invented by John Frederic Daniell in 1836, and it consists of a copper container with a copper sulfate solution, a porous pot or salt bridge, and a zinc sulfate solution with a zinc electrode. In summary, the Daniell cell is a specific type of galvanic cell, and both of these terms fall under the broader category of voltaic cells.
What is single electrode potential?	In an open-circuit, the metal electrode, in each half-cell transfers its ions into the solution. Thus an individual electrode develops a potential with respect to the solution. It is the single electrode potential. In short: The amount of the charge produced on the individual electrode is its single electrode potential.
On what factors does single electrode potential depend?	(a) concentration of ions in solution(C); (b) tendency to form ions(ion); and (c) temperature(T)
Standard Potential or EMF is what?	It is the measure of the individual potential of the reversible electrode at standard state with ion at an effective concentration of 1M at 25 degrees C. It is represented by Eo (E not).
What is the standard condition for gases to calculate EMF?	1 atm pressure.
What is a reversible cell?	A cell whose current flow can be changed by applying outer current oppositely to the direction of the generated current in the cell is called a reversible cell. Here chemical reactions occur reversely.
Determination of potential of a half cell.	Emeasured = Eright-Eleft = Ecathode-Eanode; Mnemonic: consider left-hand writing, the last part is on the right side while the starting was left. So change = right (finishing point) - left (starting point)
If a standard half-cell acts as an anode, what will be the potential?	El=0, so Emeasured = Er = Ec
If a standard half-cell acts as the cathode, what will be the potential?	Ec=0, so Emeasured = -El = -Ea
What is the half-cell EMF of Zn|Zn2+ || H+|H2(1atm)Pt?	Emeasured = Er-El = Ec-Ea; Here Zn is on the left, so it is the anode and H is the cathode that's EMF is principally El=0. So the EMF of the cell, Em = Er-0.
Half cell reactions in Zn|Zn2+ || H+|H2(1atm)Pt	Zn -> Zn2+ + 2e-, 2H+ + e- -> H2
Pt,H2(1atm)|H+ || Cu2+|Cu
EMF of the standard hydrogen electrode is 	arbitrarily assigned the value of zero volts.
Write down the Nernst equation for half cell.
