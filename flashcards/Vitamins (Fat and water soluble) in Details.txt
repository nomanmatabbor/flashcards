Vitamin D formation reaction	img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/vitamin%20d%20formation.png)
Vitamin K feature	acts in the formation of prothrombin, a blood plasma protein essential in blood clot formation. That is why its deficiency causes blood haemorrhage.
Hematopoietic vitamins 	are used for the formation of blood or blood cells. It is found in bone marrow, liver, and spleen. In the hematopoietic system, Hematopoiesis occurs. Hematopoiesis is the process through which the body manufactures blood cells. Hematopoiesis begins during the first weeks of embryonic development.
Why are B vitamins called energy vitamins? 	because vitamin B complexes help energy-yielding nutrients (such as carbohydrates, fat and protein) to generate energy as coenzymes. 
Which vitamin is toxic to viruses, bacteria, and some malignant tumour cells?	vitamin C
Only L-Ascorbic acid 	is the vitamin C
Antioxidant	 is defined as a compound that is able to neutralize free radicals, such as oxygen, nitrogen and lipidic radicals and protect a biological system. It is a man-made or natural substance. 
Antioxidant do	It protects cells from the damage caused by free radicals (unstable molecules that are made by the process of oxidation during normal metabolism). 
Which vitamin has antioxidant substances?	Vitamins A, C and E contain antioxidant substances

What does vitamin A do? 	 Promotes good vision  Generates pigments for the retina  Maintains surface lining of eyes  Helps bone growth  Regulates immune system  Helps to make healthy skin
Osteomalacia	bone softening disorder causes a deficiency of vitamin D.
What does vitamin D do? 	 Builds healthy bones and teeth  D helps regulate the amount of Ca and P in the body  Supporting immune, brain, and nervous system health
What does vitamin E do?	 Protects cell membranes and other fat-soluble parts of the body (LDL cholesterol) from oxidation. May reduce the risk of heart disease. May also discourage the development of some types of cancer. Promotes normal growth and development. Promotes normal red blood cell formation. Acts as an anti-blood clotting agent. Plays some role in the body’s ability to process glucose. Also been known to aid the process of wound healing.
Freezing foods may destroy vitamin 	K, but heating has no effect
Signs of Deficiency for K 	Antibiotics will interfere with the normal production of Vitamin K in the intestine Gallbladder or biliary disease Liver disease Ongoing diarrhea Heavy menstrual bleeding Vitamin K stores are typically low in newborns and are at risk of hemorrhage This is why infants are given vitamin K injections within 6 hours of delivery
