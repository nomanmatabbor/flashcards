Know about 	Glycolysis with diagram, steps in details
Glycolysis 	Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose into pyruvate, releasing energy. It occurs in the cytoplasm and consists of two phases: the preparatory phase, which consumes ATP, and the payoff phase, which generates ATP and NADH. The net result is the production of two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Glycolysis is a fundamental process in cellular energy production.
Glycolysis features	 Glycolysis (from the Greek glykys, “sweet” or “sugar,” and lysis, “splitting”)  Glucose occupies a central position in the metabolism of plants, animals, and many microorganisms.
 The process of the breakdown of glucose into pyruvate is termed glycolysis.  Glucose is a good fuel; the complete oxidation of glucose to carbon dioxide and water proceeds with a standard free-energy change of 22,840 kJ/mol

Glycolysis Phases	Glycolysis comprises two phases: the preparatory phase and the payoff phase. In the preparatory phase, glucose undergoes phosphorylation and conversion to fructose derivatives, leading to the formation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Two ATP molecules are invested in this phase, increasing the free-energy content. The payoff phase involves the oxidation and phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, producing 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and releasing energy. The subsequent conversion to pyruvate conserves energy, resulting in the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. The net yield is two ATP molecules per glucose, compensating for the earlier investment. Additionally, two NADH molecules are formed per glucose in the payoff phase.
Phosphorylated Intermediates	Phosphorylated intermediates are molecules in metabolic pathways, like glycolysis, where a phosphate group is added to them. 
Phosphorylated Intermediates's Importance	In glycolysis, these intermediates play crucial roles in <b>1. preventing their exit from cells, 2. conserving energy, and 3. enhancing enzymatic reactions by lowering activation energy</b>. Examples include glucose 6-phosphate and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. <br>More: img(https://i.imgur.com/6qMePpb.png)

Gluconeogenesis	Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway in the liver and kidneys that produce glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and glycerol. It acts as the reverse of glycolysis, helping maintain blood glucose levels during fasting or low-carbohydrate conditions and enabling the body to produce glucose when dietary sources are scarce.

What are the bypasses in gluconeogenesis?	1. Conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate (First bypass)<br>2. Conversion of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose 6-phosphate (Second bypass)<br>3. Conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to glucose (Third bypass)
Phosphorylation means 	the addition of phosphate group
What converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA?	Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA with the help of the enzyme- Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. • It is the process of oxidative decarboxylation whereby a carbon dioxide molecule occurs in the citric acid cycle. • The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex consists of three enzymes and five coenzymes. • This reaction is carried out in the mitochondrial matrix. • The overall reaction is: 2Pyruvate + 2NAD+ + 2CoA ⇢ 2AcetylCoA + CO2 + 2NADH <br>img(https://i.imgur.com/9FQPhye.png)
What is the link reaction between glycolysis and the TCA cycle?	img(https://i.imgur.com/MPalPME.png)
What is the importance of phosphate in glycolysis?	A phosphate group is transferred from ATP to glucose, making glucose-6-phosphate. Glucose6-phosphate is more reactive than glucose, and the addition of the phosphate also traps glucose inside the cell since glucose with a phosphate can't readily cross the membrane.
What are phosphorylated intermediates?	Intermediates of glycolysis are 1. Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), 2. Fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), 3. Fructose1,6bisphosphate (F1,6P), 4. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 5. Dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP), 6. 1,3-bisphoglycerate, 7. 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 8. 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), 9. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
How many enzymes involved in glycolysis?	 • Hexokinase • Phosphohexose isomerase • Phosphofructokinase-1 • Aldolase • Triosephosphate isomerase • Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase • Phosphoglycerate kinase • Phosphoglycerate mutase • Enolase • Pyruvate kinase
How much ATP is produced during glycolysis? 	1 NADH= 3 ATP; 1 ATP = 1 ATP; Total (net) ATP produced in glycolysis = 2 x 3 ATP + 2 ATP = 8 ATP
What is the reason for glucose phosphorylation during glycolysis? 	Phosphorylation serves multiple purposes: <br>1. It prevents intermediates from escaping the cell, despite concentration differences inside and outside the cell. <br>2. Phosphorylated intermediates serve as energy donors. <br>3. The binding of a phosphate group facilitates enzyme activity in catalyzing the reaction.
Where are the control points in the glycolytic pathway?	Ans: Steps 1, 3 and 10.<br>In glycolysis, three reactions are control points. The first is the reaction of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by hexokinase; the second, which is the production of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase; and the last is the reaction of PEP to pyruvate, catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. These reactions can be inhibited by the following: img(https://i.imgur.com/uxOVT7e.png)

How does the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol in anaerobic conditions occur?	Pyruvate is decarboxylated first to acetaldehyde by the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)requiring the enzyme pyruvate decarboxylase. The resulting product acetaldehyde, is then reduced by NADH to form ethanol by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase and reforms NAD+. img(https://i.imgur.com/QbYPhau.png)
How are the irreversible steps bypassed in gluconeogenesis? What are they?	Three reactions of glycolysis are essentially irreversible in vivo and cannot be used in gluconeogenesis. In gluconeogenesis, the three irreversible steps are bypassed by a separate set of enzymes, catalyzing reactions that are sufficiently exergonic to be effectively irreversible in the direction of glucose synthesis.
