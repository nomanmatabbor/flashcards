differential pulse voltammetry	one potential is applied for each drop
Small pulses of 	constant amplitude are superimposed on a linear potential ramp applied to the working electrode
height of the pulse is called 	its modulation amplitude
Potentials are applied 	just before the end of each drop
Each pulse of magnitude	 5-100 mV is applied 
when applied 	during the last 60 ms of the life of each mercury drop.
used to measure	 trace levels of organic and inorganic species

The charging current contribution to the differential current	 is negligible
The detection limit is	 as low as 10-8 M (~ 1 Î¼g/L)
What is charging current?	
dpv Consists of 	current peaks
The height of peaks is	 directly proportional to the concentration of analyte
The peak-shaped response exhibits 	higher resolution than DC polarography
- The peak potential (Ep) occurs	 near the polarographic half-wave potential and 
Ep can be used to 	identify the species
