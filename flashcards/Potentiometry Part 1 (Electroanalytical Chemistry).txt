Lesson: Potentiometry Part 1	We will learn about principles, types, techniques, applications, diagrams and calculation of pH in this part. This is important in Electroanalytical Chemistry.
What is the potentiometric method?	Through this, we can measure the potential of the electrochemical cell without drawing appreciable current.
Why potentiometric method is important?	Through it, we can measure the potential of the electrochemical cell without drawing appreciable current.
Types of potentiometric method	1. Direct measurement, 2. EMF changing measurement(is done by the addition of a titrant to the sample).
Usage	1. To calculate the activity of an active ion(by direct measurement), 2. To locate the Endpoint in titration(by EMF changing measurement).

What is a reference electrode	The half-cell that has known electrode potential remains constant at constant temperature and is independent of the composition of the analyte solution.
What is an Indicator electrode?	That has a potential that varies in a known way with variations in the concentration of an analyte is called an indicator electrode.
What is liquid junction potential? 	Junction potential is the potential that develops at the interface between two ionic solutions due to the difference in mobility of ions.
Example of Junction potential with diagram	Developing potential at the interface of the two solutions due to an unequal distribution of cations and anions across the boundary due to differences in the rates at which these species diffuse. img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/Screenshot_218.png)
How can you eliminate this?	placing a salt bridge consisting of a saturated solution such as potassium chloride (KCl).
Write the requirement of the reference electrode.	Reversibility, reproducibility, stability (mnemonic: race).
Configuration of reference electrode.	Reference electrodes consist of three parts: 1. Internal element. 2. Filling solution which constitutes the salt bridge electrolyte. 3. Area of the tip in the electrode that permits control flow of filling solution.
Mention the types of Reference electrodes. 	Three types: 1. Standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), 2. Standard Silver-Silver Chloride Electrode (Ag/AgCl), 3. Standard calomel electrode (SCE)
SHE is not used in the laboratory because	 Hydrogen gas can form explosive mixtures with air.
What is a silver-silver chloride electrode? Provide a schematic diagram. 	This electrode can be represented by Ag, AgCl | Cl– (1 M). The half-cell reaction of the Ag-AgCl electrode is AgCl + e– -> Ag+  Cl–. A schematic diagram of Ag, AgCl coupled with standard hydrogen electrode is given below: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/Screenshot_219.png)
Single silver-silver electrode diagram	This is preferable to be the Ag, AgCl electrode: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/silver-silver electrode single.png)
Mention the limitations of silver-silver chloride electrodes.	Limitations: 1. Not applicable in solutions that contain proteins, sulfide, bromide, or iodide. 2. Also Strong reducing agents should be avoided because they can reduce the Ag+ to Ag at the liquid junction.
What is a calomel electrode? Draw the figure, and write down the half-cell reaction. What is the cell notation of the calomel electrode with SHE? 	All answers are given in this image: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/calomel electrode, half cell reaction, cell notation.png)
What is an indicator electrode? 	The electrode that responds rapidly and reproducibly to changes in the concentration of analyte ions is called an indicator electrode. 
Write down the types of these electrodes.	Indicator electrodes have three types: ✓ Metallic ✓ Membrane ✓ Ion-sensitive field effect transistor (Mnemonic: MIM)
Metallic electrode types	Three types: ✓ Electrodes of the first kind ✓ Electrodes of the second kind ✓ Inert metallic electrode for redox system
What is the first kind of metal electrode? Show the equation with a graph plot. 	A pure metal electrode that is in direct equilibrium with its cation in the solution is the first kind of metal electrodes. Here is the equation and graph with example: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/first kind of metal electrode equation and graph with example.png)
What are the limitations? 	Limitations of electrodes of the first kind: ✓ Selectivity: Not very selective for example, 1. many metal electrodes such as zinc and cadmium, can only be used in neutral and basic solutions because they dissolve in the presence of acids, 2. the metal electrode can only be used when analyte solutions are deaerated to remove oxygen ✓ Metal: Iron, chromium, cobalt and nickel do not provide reproducible potential
What is the second kind of metal electrode? 	 The electrode of the first kind is called the electrode of the second kind when it responds to the activity of an ion(Mn+) that is in equilibrium. Calomel electrodes and Ag/AgCl electrodes are examples of electrodes of the second kind.
Example of second kind electrodes with Nernst equation	Ag/AgCl electrode details is enough for this, img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/second%20kind%20electrode%20example%20with%20nernst%20equation.png)
Which electrodes are used to monitor the redox system?	Platinum, gold, palladium, and carbon can be used to monitor redox systems.
21. What is a glass electrode, draw a figure.	Glass electrode having. Usually, it is used for measuring the pH of a given solution. The potential of the glass electrode depends on the H+ ion concentration of the solution. The EMF is determined generally by coupling with a standard calomel electrode (SCE). img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/glass%20electrode%20with%20a%20test%20solution.png)
How does a glass electrode develop potential?	The potential is developed by the concentration difference of H+ ions on the two sides of the membrane.
How to measure the pH using a hydrogen electrode? Show with equation.	To measure pH by hydrogen electrode, we have to couple a SHE and a NHE (normal hydrogen electrode). Then for the right side (NHE) or cathode potential is calculated as -0.0591pH. Now, as we coupled SHE and NHE, the cell potential is calculated by Ecell = 0 - Ecathode = 0 - (-0.0591pH). The below image shows all the things with proper diagram and explanation: img(https://flash.cardcodegenerator.com/images/ph%20calculation%20by%20standard%20hydrogen%20electrode.png)
How to measure the pH using a glass electrode and a calomel electrode? Draw the figure with caution. 	Here is the figure with the necessary equation to calculate pH: img(/images/ph%20calculation%20using%20glass%20electrode%20and%20calomel%20electrode.png)
What are the merits of glass electrodes? 	1. Simple to operate. 2. Not easily poisoned. 3. Not affected by strong oxidizing and reducing agents.
