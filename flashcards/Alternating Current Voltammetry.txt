AC VOLTAMMETRY	Alternating current frequency-domain technique img(https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi8NebLIHZLEh77ohhSCXcb6SAijzhROS3x5MEyLsEHZcLSxrvLMrNCpWbuSzxZIBRWtn_E3bIkvQMJ-Jpfh58H9QuIkEg74RZqDRKmt5FzxTgEvj8JwFEe8n8muU0Zqr4D1L_RDjRSgY_y1zCMWjGQUKEBsjGeJBgkYozSLTwBOqT5d3QKeKA9w06Op2ZX)
Involves the superimposition	 of a small amplitude AC voltage on a linear ramp
Frequency is usually 	between 50 and 100 Hz
Amplitude between	 10 and 20 mV
- AC signal causes perturbation	 in the surface concentration 
- AC current is plotted	 against potential
- Peak potential is the same as	 that of the polarographic half-wave potential
-Large amplitude AC	 (>50mV) allows identification of specific components via higher harmonics “fingerprinting”
- Useful for the study of 	electron processes 
- Suitable for or used for 	fast electron transfer kinetics

- Peak height is proportional to 	analyte concentration
- for reversible systems, Peak height is proportional to	 the square root of frequency (ω) 
- Peak with is independent of	 frequency = 90.4/n mV at 25 oC
