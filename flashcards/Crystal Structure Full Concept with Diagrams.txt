Definition of Crystal	A crystal is a solid which have an ordered and repeating atomic arrangement, resulting in specific geometric shapes and properties.
Types of Crystals	Ionic Crystals, Covalent Network Crystals, Metallic Crystals, Molecular Crystals, Coordination Network Crystals, Amorphous Solids, Quasicrystals
Crystal system	A crystal system is a geometric classification for crystals based on the relationships between the sides and angles of their unit cells. 
How many crystal systems still now?	There are seven systems: Cubic, Tetragonal, Orthorhombic, Rhombohedral, Monoclinic, Triclinic, and Hexagonal. img(https://img.brainkart.com/imagebk39/L9IZFbt.jpg)
Unit cell	A unit cell is the smallest repeating structure in a crystal lattice, defining the basic building block of the crystal.
Types of unit cells	Primitive and Non-primitive
Primitive Unit Cell	A primitive unit cell consists of a single lattice point, originating from each corner of the unit cell. In other words, the "one lattice point" in a primitive unit cell refers to the contribution of one point at each corner, collectively forming the entire unit cell.
Non-primitive Unit Cell	Non-primitive unit cells house extra lattice points—either on a face or within the unit cell—resulting in more than one lattice point per unit cell. This distinction highlights that non-primitive cells contain additional points beyond those positioned at the corners.

Comparison
Crystal lattice	The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystal, forming a repeating pattern.
Distinguish the concept of the unit cell and crystal lattice	The unit cell and crystal lattice both are three-dimensional but we have to consider lattice rather than unit cell to understand and predict material properties on a larger scale, including macroscopic behavior and diffraction patterns. As unit cell merely provides local details.
Bravis lattice	A Bravais lattice is a specific type of lattice that represents the periodic arrangement of points in a crystal that is defined by a set of translation vectors and characterizes the symmetry and periodicity of the crystal structure.
Miller indices	It is a system of notation used in crystallography to represent planes and directions of a crystal lattice. They are a set of three integers (h, k, l) enclosed in parentheses and denote the reciprocal intercepts of a crystallographic plane or direction with the axes of the unit cell.
Lattice plane	A lattice plane is an imaginary, infinite two-dimensional flat surface in a crystal lattice. It is described using Miller indices, representing the relative spacing and orientation of the plane with respect to the crystallographic axes. Lattice planes play a crucial role in crystallography for characterizing the arrangement of atoms or molecules within a crystal structure.
Notation of those planes is called 	Miler indices.
Indices of Direction	The direction [hkl] is parallel to the normal vector of the plane (hkl) with the same indices. That means the normal vector is perpendicular to the plane (hkl)

Usage of different brackets and their meaning in Miler indices	Square brackets [] indicate a specific direction. For example, in a cubic system [100] and [010] are perpendicular directions.<br>Angle brackets <> indicate a family of directions. For example, in a cubic system angle <100> angle includes these directions [100], [\bar{1}00], [010], [0\bar{1}0], [001], and [00\bar{1}]. <br>img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-of-directions.svg)<br>Parenthesis () indicate a specific plane. For example, in a cubic system (100) and (010) are perpendicular planes.<br>Curly brackets {} indicate a family of planes. For example, in a cubic system {100} includes (100), (\bar{1}00), (010), (0\bar{1}0), (001), and (00\bar{1}).<br> img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-of-planes.svg)<br>Image credit: <a href="https://msestudent.com/miller-indices/">Mes student</a>
Miller indices for points	img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Miller-Indices-for-Points.svg)<br>Remember when describing points you write the point as (h, k, l). You also use negative signs, rather than the “bar” notation. In other words, you write  (-h, -k, -l)  instead of (\bar{h}, \bar{k}, \bar{l}).
Miller indices for direction	img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Directions-in-a-cubic-crystal.svg)
Miler indices for planes	Here we need to know about reciprocal space. Reciprocal space means to take the inverse of a point that you are thinking of. The inverse of 1 is 1 itself, the inverse of 2 is 1/2 and 0 is infinity. <br>Here are the three steps to find out the Miller indices of a plane:<br>1. Find out the point where the plane intersects each axis. If a plane doesn't intersect an axis and is parallel to that axis, the intersection point will be ∞.<br>2. take the inverse of each intersection point.<br>3. Put those 3 values in the proper (hkl) format. Remember that negatives are expressed with a bar, parenthesis () indicates a specific plane. Don’t use any commas or spaces! <br>img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Finding-Miller-Indices-for-Planes.svg)<br>In a cubic system, it turns out that the direction  [hlk]  will always be perpendicular to the plane  (hkl). For example, the  [110]  direction is perpendicular to the  (110)  plane.<br>img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/hkl-hkl-relationship.svg)<br>This is not necessarily true in non-cubic systems.

Draw the directions  [\bar{1}00]  and  [010], and write the Miller Index for the plane common to both directions.	img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Miller-Indices-Task-4-Part-1.svg)<br>img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Miller-Indices-Task-4-Part-2.svg)<br>img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Miller-Indices-Task-4-Part-3.svg)
Draw the  (220)  and  (110)  planes in a cubic crystal.	By the reciprocal rule, the (220)  plane intersects the x-axis at ½, the y-axis at ½, and never intersects the z-axis. The (110)  plane intersects the x-axis at 1, and the y-axis at 1, and never intersects the z-axis. We can draw that like this. img(https://msestudent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Task-5-Answer-Miller-Indices.svg)<br>Notice that the  (220)  and  (110)  are parallel, but not identical. If I had an atom at  (0, ½,  ½)  it would intersect the  (220)  plane but not the (110)  plane. This distinction matters more if you do diffraction experiments.

Brillouin zone	The Brillouin zone simplifies the analysis of wave behaviour, such as electron waves, in a crystal lattice, representing the repeating pattern for the study of material properties.
Reciprocal lattice	The reciprocal lattice is a mathematical tool used in crystallography to describe the spatial frequencies of a crystal's atomic arrangement, crucial for analyzing diffraction patterns and wave interactions.
Symmetry elements	Geometrical entities within an object, such as points, lines, or planes, that exhibit symmetry under specific operations, preserving the object's appearance.
Symmetry operations	Symmetry operations refer to transformations, such as rotations or reflections, performed with respect to symmetry elements within an object. These operations showcase and maintain the object's symmetrical properties, ensuring its appearance remains unchanged.
Types of symmetry elements	Point of symmetry, Axis of symmetry and Plane of symmetry.
Point of symmetry types	Point Symmetry (Inversion): Object remains unchanged after a 180-degree rotation around a point.<br><br>Center of Symmetry: Point where every opposite point has an equal distance from the centre.
The axis of symmetry types	Axis of Rotation: The object looks the same after rotating by a specific angle around an axis.<br>Rotational Axis: Similar to the axis of rotation but involves rotation by specific angles, like a 60-degree rotational axis.<br>Proper Rotation Axis: The object remains unchanged after rotation by a certain angle (e.g., 90 degrees for a square).<br>Improper Rotation Axis: Combines rotation and a reflection or inversion operation, resulting in an unchanged appearance.<br>Rotoreflection: A combination of rotation and reflection, where the object looks the same after both operations.<br>Rotoinversion: Combines rotation and inversion, leaving the object unchanged.<br>Screw Axis:<br>img(https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Pure_screw.svg/1200px-Pure_screw.svg.png)<br>Involves both rotation and translation along the axis, creating a helical pattern. <br>

Types of symmetry operations	Rotation (Proper Rotation): The object looks the same after rotating by a certain angle around a point or axis.<br>Reflection (Mirror Operation): The object is identical when reflected across a plane.<br>Translation (Shift): Shifting the object along a direction without rotation or reflection.<br>Inversion (Point Reflection): The object remains unchanged after being inverted through a point.<br>Rotation-Inversion (Rotoinversion): A combination of rotation and inversion, leaving the object unchanged.<br>Improper Rotation: Combines rotation with a reflection, resulting in an unchanged appearance.<br>Glide Reflection (Glide Operation): A combination of translation and reflection, creating a glide plane.<br>Screw Rotation (Screw Operation): Involves rotation about an axis combined with translation along the axis, creating a helical motion.
Axis/Line of Symmetry	It is a line about which the crystal may be rotated so that it represents the same appearance more than once during a complete rotation.
Plane of Symmetry	A crystal is considered to have a plane of symmetry when an imaginary plane passing through the centre of a crystal can divide it into two parts such that one is the exact mirror image of the other.
Center of Symmetry	It is a point such that any line drawn through it will meet the surface of the crystal at equal distances on either side.
Center of Inversion Symmetry	Inversion through the centre of symmetry leaves the molecule unchanged. Inversion consists of passing each point through the centre of inversion and out to the same distance on the other side of the molecule. If inversion symmetry exists, a line drawn from any atom through the centre will connect with an equivalent atom at an equivalent distance from the centre
Point Symmetry/groups	Combination of SEs at a common point
Point symmetry elements	mirror plane, rotation axis, inversion axis, alternating axis, centre of symmetry
Space symmetry elements	Glide plane and screw axis
Space Symmetry/groups	Combination of SEs in a space lattice

Ions are arranged in a Zinc blend	in a Cubic Close Packing (CCP) manner
Discuss the structure of the Zinc blend	The S<sup>2-</sup> ions are present in FCC (Face Centered Cubic) arrangement which means the S<sup>2-</sup> ions are present at the corner of the cube and at the centre of each face.<br>Each Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion is surrounded tetrahedrally by four S<sup>2-</sup> ions and each S<sup>2-</sup> ion is surrounded tetrahedrally by four Zn2+ ions. Thus the structure has 4:4 coordination. img(https://cdn1.byjus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Zinc-blende-structure-3.png)

Wurtzite chemical formula	ZnS
Discuss Wurtzite structure	This is different from the Zinc Blende structure but has the same coordination number 4:4. <br>In the Wurtzite structure, the sulphide ion is arranged in the HCP (hexagonal close-packed) structure.
Why does Wurtzite have 6 formula units per unit cell?	No. of Zn<sup>+2</sup> ions per unit cell = {4 (within the unit cell) × 1} + {6 (at edge centres) × 1/3} = 6<br>No. of S<sup>-2</sup> ions per unit cell = {12 (at corners) ×1/6} + {2 (at face centres) × ½ } + {3 (within the unit cell) × 1} = 6<br>Thus, there are 6 formula units per unit cell.
